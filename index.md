My economic research focuses on the impact of global supply chain disruptions on agri-food trade. Leveraging skills in economics, machine learning, and programming, I uncover insights into the complex challenges of international trade, supply chain, and environemtal economics. My dissertation paper is titled "Agri-food trade in times of supply chain disruptions".
