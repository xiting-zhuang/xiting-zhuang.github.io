## About Me

<img src="https://xiting-zhuang.github.io/images/Zhuang_headshot_full.JPG" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480" style="float: right:">


Here is **Xiting Zhuang ([庄曦庭](https://xiting-zhuang.github.io/file/XitingZhuang-CV.pdf))**.

I'm a doctoral candidate in **Agricultural and Resource Economics** at the University of Connecticut, concurrently pursuing a Master's degree in **Computer Science** with a specialization in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I bridge the realms of economics and technology by applying advanced computational techniques to unravel intricate patterns and insights within global agri-food trade dynamic. 

My economic research focuses on the impact of global supply chain disruptions on agri-food trade. Leveraging skills in economics, machine learning, and programming, I uncover insights into the complex challenges of international trade, supply chain, and environemtal economics. My dissertation paper is titled "Agri-food trade in times of supply chain disruptions". Currently, I am working as a research assistant in the **Computer Science and Engineering Department**. Here is [my CV](https://xiting-zhuang.github.io/file/XitingZhuang-CV.pdf).
