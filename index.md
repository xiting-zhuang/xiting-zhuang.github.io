## About Me
<br>





Here is **Xiting Zhuang ([庄曦庭](https://xiting-zhuang.github.io/file/XitingZhuang-CV.pdf))**. I'm a doctoral candidate in **Agricultural and Resource Economics** at the University of Connecticut, concurrently pursuing a Master's degree in **Computer Science** with a specialization in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I bridge the realms of economics and technology by applying advanced computational techniques to unravel intricate patterns and insights within global agri-food trade dynamic. Currently, I am under the supervision of [Prof. Sandro Steinbach] and working as a research assistant in the **Computer Science and Engineering Department** at UConn. Here is [my CV](https://xiting-zhuang.github.io/file/XitingZhuang-CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

- Supply Chain
- International Trade
- Environmental Economics
- Causal Inference
 
My economic research focuses on the impact of global supply chain disruptions on agri-food trade. Leveraging skills in economics, machine learning, and programming, I uncover insights into the complex challenges of international trade, supply chain, and environemtal economics. My dissertation paper is titled "Agri-food trade in times of supply chain disruptions".
