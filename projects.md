## Census Trade Data Scraper for Chinese Customs Data. 
- The Census Trade Data Scraper is a tool to retrieve trade data from the Chinese Customs website (中国海关数据). This innovative system not only enables real-time data extraction but also surpasses slide authentication barriers, ensuring access to critical trade information. Each run of the scraper can download up to 100,000 samples, increasing the efficiency of data acquisition. The tool further streamlines the process by performing batch conversions to both CSV and Stata file formats.
